Hello all,

Thanks for checking out my blog post! 

Hope you are liking my website. 

Here are some cool things I've been doing in quarantine: baking, running, listening to podcasts, and finding new music. I've made banana bread and earl grey tea yogurt bread, hit a new personal record for my mileage distance, learned a lot from Brene Brown's podcasts, and found some really cool music on SoundCloud!! 

Hope everyone's doing well and keeping safe!
